            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE desire we have had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Your <hi>Majesty</hi> a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory account of what, by Your most gracious Letter the fourth of <hi>June,</hi> was intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to us, for trying of the contrivance and carrying on that design of Billeting, (with which Your <hi>Majesty</hi> with so much reason declared Your self most unsatisfied) hath occasioned, that we have not sooner made these humble and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledgments, which the gracious expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in the former part of Your Letter call for; Being desirous, that the account of our duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and hearty obedience to these Your <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties</hi> most just Commands, might accompany
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:180344:3"/>our due acknowledgments of Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Grace and Goodness, and that our return might not divide, what Your <hi>Majesty</hi> hath by Your Royal Letter joyned.</p>
            <p>We do, with all humble duty and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, acknowledge the great blessings which this Your ancient Kingdom doth now enjoy under Your Royal Authority, The Church being restored to it's right Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Kingdom to its former Peace, the Laws to their free Course, and the Subjects to their just Liberties; And all these flowing to us as the happy fruits and effects of Your <hi>Majesties</hi> blessed Restitution, we conceive our selves obliged in a due resentment thereof, and of the often and renewed expressions of Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Royal care and tenderness of this Kingdom, to return the humble offer of our lives and fortunes, and all that is dearest to us, for the advancement of Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Authority and Greatness: And that it shall be our care, that the expressions of our obedience to Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Commands, shall be suitable to those unparallel'd Acts of Grace and Favour Your <hi>Majesty</hi> hath vouchsafed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
            <p>By Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Letter it appears, That by a Gentleman imployed last year with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Credit from the Earl of <hi>Middleton,</hi> it was represented to Your <hi>Majesty,</hi> that it was the desire of Your Parliament here, that the Act of Indempnity should carry an exception of incapacitating from publick Trust: and that he earnestly prest, in name of Your Parliament, Your <hi>Majesties</hi> consent to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:180344:3"/>incapacitating some few of the most guilty, not exceeding twelve. And your <hi>Majesty</hi> desiring to know the truth thereof from us; In obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to your <hi>Majesties</hi> Commands, this being taken into the consideration of Your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and every Member of Parliament par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly asked thereupon, we finde by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous opinions and votes of the House, That the Parliament gave no warrand, to desire of Your <hi>Majesty,</hi> that the Act of Indempnity should carry an exception of incapacitating from publick Trust, and that the Parliament gave no warrand at all, to desire in their names, Your <hi>Majesties</hi> consent to the incapacitating of a few; Yet we have seen the inclosed double of an Instruction, given by the Earl of <hi>Middleton</hi> in the contrary, to Sir <hi>George Mackenzie,</hi> signed and owned by him in presence of your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be a just double, bearing, that it was much desired by Your Parliament, that some should be excepted from publick Trust.</p>
            <p>We also finde no other ground in the Act of Parliament concerning Billetting, neither do we remember of any other ground made use of before the Articles, or in the Parliament, for incapacitating, but that it was Your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties</hi> pleasure to have it so, and that this was the rise of bringing in the Act of Billetting, as the most expedient way of voting the Act for Incapacitie.</p>
            <p>And in obedience to Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands for the further tryall of the manner of contrivance and carrying on this design of Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting, and Your <hi>Majesties</hi> suspicion that Your Name was abused therein; some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180344:4"/>authorized by Your Parliament, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken the depositions of divers Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, and two Knights, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and having delivered the principal depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions to Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Commissioner, to be by his Grace communicated to Your <hi>Majesty,</hi> Have offered to us this particular account thereof under their hand-writings, which we (without presuming at all to give any judgment thereupon) offer hereby to Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Royal consideration; And when Your <hi>Majesty</hi> shall be pleased to make Your further pleasure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in known to us, we shall give such obedience thereto, and to the other particulars in Your Royal Letter, as shall witness to the world, that Your <hi>Majesties</hi> Royal Judgment is the rule of our actions, and that your <hi>Majesties</hi> Commands shall alwayes receive that obedience from us, which suits with the duty of good Subjects, and the relation we now serve Your <hi>Majesty</hi> in, as Your <hi>Majesties</hi> most loyal and faithful Parliament; In whose Name, and by whose Command, these are signed by,</p>
